# cdk-esbuild

*CDK constructs for [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild), an extremely fast JavaScript bundler*

[Getting started](#getting-started) | [Documentation](#documentation) | [Versioning](#versioning)

## Why?

*esbuild* is an extremely fast bundler and minifier for  Typescript and JavaScript. CDK ships out-of-the-box only with support for [Parcel](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel), which *esbuild* outperforms by factor 100.

## Versioning

**Status: Experimental**

*Because this package builds on APIs that are marked experimental, it also has to be considered experimental.*

The package tracks the **minor** version number of CDK releases. It might work with newer versions of CDK, but has not been tested. Features changes will only be introduced alongside minor releases.

**Patches releases** will contain fixes to this library only and do not necessarily reflect CDK patches.
