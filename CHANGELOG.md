## [2.0.0](https://github.com/mrgrain/cdk-esbuild/compare/v1.129.0...v2.0.0) (2021-11-07)

### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

- Major release of this package to make it JSII compatible (#114) ([727c78a](https://github.com/mrgrain/cdk-esbuild/commit/727c78aefa2079d0f561b8b664d75eb6c669e46b)), closes [#114](https://github.com/mrgrain/cdk-esbuild/issues/114) [#117](https://github.com/mrgrain/cdk-esbuild/issues/117) [#119](https://github.com/mrgrain/cdk-esbuild/issues/119) [#120](https://github.com/mrgrain/cdk-esbuild/issues/120) [#123](https://github.com/mrgrain/cdk-esbuild/issues/123)

- Deprecated features from v1 have been removed. Please see upgrading instructions below.

### Upgrading to v2

- Update the package dependency to v2: `npm install --save @mrgrain/cdk-esbuild@^2.0.0`
- `esbuild` is now installed as an optional dependency. If your setup does not automatically install optional dependencies, add it as an explicit dependency.
- Remove any use of `bundlerPriority`.
- Unstable construct `EsbuildBundling` has been renamed to `EsbuildBundler` and its interface has slightly changed. Like most other constructs, it now takes `entryPoints` as first parameter, with an optional `props` object as the second.
