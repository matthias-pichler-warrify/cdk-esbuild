# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Plugin Version | CDK Version | Supported                                        |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 1.x.x          | 1.x.x       | :white_check_mark: only the latest minor version |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please raise an [issue](https://github.com/mrgrain/cdk-esbuild/issues) and add the `security` label.

I strive to respond to security issues within 48h. However this is an open source project with a single maintainer and life can get in the way.

Contributions of secrurity fixes are most welcome!
